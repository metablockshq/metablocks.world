shortBio: Creator of Meta Blocks

Hello 👋🏼
Nice to see you here! I'm creating Meta Blocks with my brother [Sarthak](https://metablocks.world/authors/sarthakkhurana). 

## What I do at Meta Blocks?
My responsibilities include building and managing the team, the product, our positioning and digital growth. I also keep pestering Sarthak with marketing ideas.

## Background

I've been working in the tech space for almost 10 years. In the past I built cybersecurity and insurance products for the Scandinavian and Brazilian markets reaching over 3 million users. Also a data-analysis and recommendation system handling over 10million users for a large mobile network in the UK.

I have first hand experience of scaling SaaS products from a few thousand to a few million users. 

As a core contributor at [Status](https://status.im) I help build the mobile app that has over a million downloads on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.status.ethereum&hl=en_IN&gl=US). I'm also an advisor for product and digital growth at [SkillsTrainer](https://skillstrainer.in) - worlds largest vocational skilling platform with over 1.2 million registered users.


## Contact me

I'm fairly active on twitter and discord if you'd like to talk.
